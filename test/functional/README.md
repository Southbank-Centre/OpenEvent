# Protractor tests

The tests in this directory ensure that the Drupal CMS is correctly set up to allow content creation.

These tests do not create content for use by front-end tests. The front-end tests create their own content.

See the README.md in the *Southbank-Centre/SC-app/test/functional* directory for more information on using Protractor and running the tests.
